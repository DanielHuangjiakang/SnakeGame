        <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
        <p>
          Players control a snake, directing its movement. As the snake consumes
          food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself
          or the game boundary. The aim is to survive as long as possible while
          consuming food to earn higher scores.
